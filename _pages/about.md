I am a postdoctoral research fellow working with [Shuran Song](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~shurans/) at the [Columbia Artificial Intelligence and Robotics lab (CAIR)](https://cair.cs.columbia.edu/), Columbia University. Before joining her lab, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [Vision for Robotics lab (V4R)](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/vision-for-robotics/) at TU Wien, advised by [Markus Vincze](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/staff/vm/).

I am interested in robot vision approaches that perceive, learn and leverage geometrical and physical principles for scene understanding and manipulation. My research goal is to enable robots to autonomously learn these capabilities in novel situations from exploratory interaction.
