I am a postdoctoral research fellow at the [Robotics and Embodied Artificial Intelligence Lab (REAL)](https://real.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and Columbia University, working with [Shuran Song](https://shurans.github.io/).

My research focuses on perception and learning of geometrical and physical principles for state estimation, dynamics prediction and manipulation. Through these capabilities, I want to enable robots to adapt to novel situations and learn from interactions with their environment.
