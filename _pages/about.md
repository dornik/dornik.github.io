I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [Latitude AI](https://lat.ai/).

Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the [Robotics and Embodied Artificial Intelligence Lab (REAL)](https://real.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University and Columbia University, and the [Vision for Robotics Lab (V4R)](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/vision-for-robotics/) at TU Wien.
